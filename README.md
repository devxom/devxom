# Hi there, Ilia (pronounced: Ilía)

**Inclusive interface specialist building accessible, future-friendly UI systems across web, game, and terminal platforms. Based in Portugal. Open to remote work, consulting, and relocation for onsite roles in the US, Canada, UK, and EU.**

I'm a developer, accessibility consultant, and UX designer focused on building thoughtful, inclusive, and maintainable user interfaces. My work spans the web, terminal, and game engines, with a strong foundation in systems thinking, accessibility, and future interaction design.

## What I Do

- Build accessible UI components for web, games, and terminal UIs  
- Design and implement design systems and component frameworks  
- Perform accessibility testing and audits to improve real-world usability  
- Guide and mentor teams in accessibility and developer experience  
- Contribute to education, development, and training processes around a11y and UI practices  
- Write and contribute to specifications and developer experience tooling  
- Lead projects across frontend, game development, and accessibility domains  
- Build DX-focused automation to improve workflows and team velocity  

## Interests

- Accessibility in modern interfaces and interaction patterns  
- Designing systems and tools that offer meaningful experiences — from narrative-driven game mechanics to calm, focused interaction  
- Techno-positivism: exploring how tools, environments, and AI shift how we think, create, and connect  
- Interfaces of interaction across tools, systems, and personalities — both current and emerging  
- Unconventional input methods, from old hardware to speculative controls — anything that extends how people (and others) relate to tech and the world  

## Philosophy

- Accessibility is not an add-on. It is a core part of good UI and UX design  
- Simplicity and clarity scale better than complexity  
- Interfaces should serve everyone, with empathy and precision
